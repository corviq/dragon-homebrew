        <description>
            <p class="flavor">The rarest and most vicious of all dragons, Black Dragons are filled with magic. They are born with acid in their blood and are feared across the entire continent, above and below the ground. They are said to be harbingers of death and evil, and the mere appearance of one is said to bring about terrible things, though nobody can prove if that is true.</p>
            <h4>FEARSOME NIGHT WALKERS</h4>
            <p>Black Dragons sometimes are referred to as 'night walkers' since they are mostly seen at night, and they blend into darkness and the light sky perfectly other than their wings and eyes.</p>
            <p class="indent">The rarity of Black Dragons adds to the fear surrounding them. Some even refuse to believe they are real due to their rarity, earning them many legends and places in folklore.</p>
            <h4>VIOLENT MONSTERS</h4>
            <p>Due to being so outcast and feared by society, Black Dragons are often just as fierce as they are rumoured to be, having grown with nothing but hatred for them. However, it is not a biological issue, and Black Dragons can be just as kind as they can be cruel if they have the right environment.</p>
            <p class="indent">Some Black Dragons shine with a different colour when the light hits their scales, though their darkness always shows. These dragons are said to be less vicious than others of their kind, but nobody can prove or disprovem it.</p>
            <p class="indent">It is said that the dragons with the red eyes are the most dangerous, when there is no difference between the behaviours of dragons with different eye colours.</p>
            <h4>VAMPIRE ESSENCE</h4>
            <p>Black Dragons naturally have acidic blood, though it does have magical effects too.
            <h4>BLACK DRAGON NAMES</h4>
            <p>Black Dragons usually have short names that are easy to say and read. They usually aren't very long, and names with two parts will always consist of short sounds or words. Male names usually consist of rarer letters, whereas female names tend to consist mainly of soft and common letters.</p>
            <p>
            <b>Male Names: </b>Zaro, Tavi, Xeno, Ura'vo, Saf're
            <br/>
            <b>Female Names: </br>Nova, Lora, Eros, Fa'ria, Nos'tar
            <br/>
            <b>Neutral Names: </br>Zanova, Xeria, Rivia, Ri'loris, Noc'safi
            <br/>
            <p>
            <h4>BLACK DRAGON TRAITS</h4>
            <p>Black Dragons all share a set of traits that are unique to them and no other dragons.</p>
            <span class="feature">Ability Score Increase.</span>Your intelligence score increases by 2, and your constitution score increases by 1.
            <br />
            <span class="feature">Age.</span>Black Dragons reach maturity at the age of twenty. There have been no deaths recorded due to old age, so their lifespan is unknown.
            <br />
            <span class="feature">Alignment.</span>Black Dragons tend to be neutral, and often on the more chaotic side.
            <br />
            <span class="feature">Size.</span>Black Dragons are, on average, 8-9ft. tall, larger than most dragons.
            <br />
            <span class="feature">Speed.</span>>Your base walking speed if 30 feet.
            <br />
            <span class="feature">Acidic Breath Weapon.</span>You can use your action to exhale destructive energy. When you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a Dexterity saving throw. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 acidic damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level.
            <br />
            <span class="feature">Vampire Essence.</span>If a creature or item comes into contact with your blood, they will be subject to burns and their life force will be partially drained. If ingested, it will do 10d10 acidic or necrotic damage. When touched, it will do 3d6 acidic or necrotic damage, 4d6 damage at 8th level, 5d6 at 11th level, and 6d6 at 16th level.
            <span class="feature">Damage Resistance.</span>You have resistance to acidic damage.
            <br />
            <span class="feature">Languages.</span>You can speak, read, and write Common and Ancient Lurquahn. Ancient Lurquahn is not often used any longer, but as they are an ancient species, most of them are raised with the language. This often considered the language of Black Dragons because of this.
